### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alois from Czech Republic, and I am currently studying computer science in Pilsen. I'm self-taught programmer and linux-based server administrator. First coding language I learned was C# because then I was working with Unity game engine. After that because of school I switched to Java then learned HTML, CSS and JS. Now I am learning PHP and Node.js to become full stack web developer
