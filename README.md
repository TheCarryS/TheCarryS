### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alois from Czech Republic, and I am currently studying information technology in Pilsen. I'm self-taught programmer and linux-based server administrator. First coding language I learned was C# because then I was working with Unity game engine. After that because of school I switched to Java. I also know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, basics of PhP and Python
